# fugel-technical-assessment
## Technical challenge as requested by the Fugel Team


## Challenge:
 1.   Create Terraform code to create an S3 bucket and an EC2 instance. Both resources must be tagged with Name=Flugel, Owner=InfraTeam.
 2.   Using Terratest, create the test automation for the Terraform code,validating that both resources are tagged properly.
 3.   In the EC2 instance, run a simple HTTP service written in Python with two endpoints:
 4.   /tags: must display EC2 instance tags.
 5.   /shutdown: must shutdown the instance.
 6.   Setup Github Actions to run a pipeline to validate this code.
 7.   Publish your code in a public GitHub repository, and share a Pull Request with your code. Do not merge into master until the PR is approved.
 8.   Include documentation describing the steps to run and test the automation.
